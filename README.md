Hello there! I'm Vrunda Bhuva, a passionate student currently pursuing my Bachelor's degree in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning (BSc AIML). 
As an enthusiast in the field of cybersecurity, I recently participated in a hackathon where I delved into the fascinating topic of Phishing Domain Detection. 
I'm thrilled to share that our project secured the 3rd position in the department, showcasing our dedication to addressing cybersecurity challenges. 
This repository serves as a testament to our efforts, featuring a robust Phishing Domain Detection Algorithm, detailed data analysis, and a user-friendly interface. 
I invite you to explore and contribute to this project as we collectively strive to create a safer online environment. Your feedback and collaboration are highly valued. Happy coding!
